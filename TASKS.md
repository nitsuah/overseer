## Todo

### P1 - High

- [ ] Connect overseer's agent task queue to agent-board's local model runtime (dispatch bridge v0).
  - Priority: P1
  - Context: overseer exposes an Agent Task Queue API and agent-board runs a local model runtime, but no bridge routes tasks between them.
  - Acceptance Criteria: a v0 bridge dispatches at least one queued overseer task to agent-board's runtime and reports completion status back to the queue.

### P2 - Medium

- [ ] Chat-driven doc editing (TASKS/ROADMAP/FEATURES) — stage 3 remaining.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: the per-repo chat panel (PR #196) only answered questions before this branch — it rebuilt context and replied, but couldn't act.
  - Acceptance Criteria: broken into stages — (1) chat can propose a specific, diffable edit to one doc file and show it inline before applying; (2) accepting the proposal opens a PR via the existing fix-doc PR flow rather than writing directly; (3) the chat can check an item off in TASKS.md or move it to FEATURES.md when the user confirms it's shipped, referencing the same parser the dashboard already uses so state never diverges from what's rendered elsewhere; (4) before calling `createPrForFile`, the caller-supplied target path must be validated against the approved doc list (TASKS.md/ROADMAP.md/FEATURES.md, matching the existing `TARGET_PATHS` mapping) — never pass a chat-supplied path straight through unchecked.
  - Status: stages (1), (2), and (4) ✅ SHIPPED — `parseDocEditProposal` in `lib/repo-chat.ts` extracts a fenced ` ```proposal``` ` JSON block from the assistant's reply; `RepoChatPanel` renders it as an inline card with Apply/Dismiss; Apply routes the proposed content into the existing preview-and-PR modal (`onApplyProposal` in `app/page.tsx`) rather than writing directly; `fix-doc`'s `TARGET_PATHS` validation (already hardened in this branch) covers the PR path. Stage (3) — checking off/moving items directly from chat — still open.

- [ ] Stale-review detector for PR readiness.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: new idea (2026-08-28) — CodeRabbit (and likely other bot reviewers) sometimes leave a PR's formal review decision at `CHANGES_REQUESTED` even after every inline finding is resolved and CI is green, silently blocking branch-protection-gated auto-merge until a human notices.
  - Acceptance Criteria: for repos with a linked PR, surface a count/badge when `reviewDecision === CHANGES_REQUESTED` but all review threads are resolved and required checks pass; link directly to the PR so the discrepancy can be verified and merged or re-reviewed.

- [ ] Add cross-repo dependency mapping.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: agent-board, bb-mcp, nitsuah-io, and overseer share overlapping stacks and could benefit from surfaced cross-repo links.
  - Acceptance Criteria: the dashboard shows inferred or declared connections between related repos and surfaces shared-stack signals; visualized as an interactive 3D graph with filter and click-to-detail interactions.
  - Status: ✅ SHIPPED (this branch) — `GET /api/dependencies` infers connections from shared topics + primary language; rendered as a collapsible SVG graph + connection list (`DependencyGraph.tsx`) on the dashboard. The 3D/click-to-detail visualization from the original acceptance criteria is not implemented — current graph is 2D SVG.

### DB & backend scaling

- [ ] Assess current DB design for scalability as repo and user count grows.
  - Priority: P2
  - Context: the current schema works at small scale; no formal review has been done for indexing strategy, query patterns at 100+ repos, or connection pooling limits.
  - Acceptance Criteria: a brief written assessment covers index coverage, slow-query candidates, and a recommendation on whether schema changes are needed before Q3 feature work.
  - Status: ✅ SHIPPED (this branch) — `docs/db-scaling-assessment.md` covers index coverage, slow-query candidates, and connection pooling.

### P3 - Exploratory

- [ ] Add zombie-branch detection.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: the UI does not yet surface stale long-lived branches.
  - Acceptance Criteria: stale branches are detected and flagged in the interface with a bulk-action dialog to delete selected branches (confirmation step, scaling across all repos); includes a "clean up hidden repos" action to safely purge DB cache for hidden/removed repos with a confirmation step noting the GH source is untouched.

- [ ] Add maintenance-mode detection.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: dormant repositories are not yet automatically classified.
  - Acceptance Criteria: inactive repos are flagged past a defined threshold.
  - Status: ✅ SHIPPED (PR #200) — `detectActivityState` in `lib/repo-signals.ts`, 90+ days no commits → "maintenance" badge on desktop + mobile cards.

- [ ] Add token-density metrics.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: token density is still only an exploratory repo-health metric.
  - Acceptance Criteria: logical-unit density is stored and surfaced usefully.
  - Status: ✅ SHIPPED (this branch) — `lib/parsers/code-density.ts` computes `token_density` from sampled source files during sync; surfaced in expanded repo stats (desktop + mobile).

- [ ] Add comment-to-code ratio metrics.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: documentation density remains an idea rather than a measured signal.
  - Acceptance Criteria: file-level and aggregate ratios are calculated and displayed.
  - Status: ✅ SHIPPED (this branch) — `comment_to_code_ratio` computed alongside token density in `lib/parsers/code-density.ts`, surfaced in expanded repo stats (desktop + mobile).

- [ ] Add a dark and light mode toggle.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: theme preferences are still not user-configurable.
  - Acceptance Criteria: the UI supports a persistent theme toggle.

- [ ] Add velocity scoring and technical-debt trending.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: commit frequency and PR merge time are captured but not yet trended over time.
  - Acceptance Criteria: a trend chart shows velocity and technical-debt signals over rolling quarters.
  - Status: ✅ SHIPPED — velocity score (PR #200) via `calculateVelocityScore` in `lib/repo-signals.ts`; trending (this branch) via a new `repo_snapshots` table recorded per sync (commit frequency, PR merge time, health score, open PRs, LOC), `GET /api/repo-details/[name]/trend`, and a health-score sparkline in `RepositoryStatsSectionStatic`.

- [ ] Agent session receipts.
  - Priority: P3
  - Context: new idea (2026-08-28) — AI Summaries describe a repo's state; nothing describes what an agent _did_ to it recently. Picking up mid-portfolio work today means reconstructing activity from commit messages and PR history by hand across every repo.
  - Acceptance Criteria: a lightweight per-repo activity log surfaced in both the chat panel and the PMO view, built on the existing dispatch/queue seams rather than a new schema — persist a `sessionId` (correlating with the `motorPoolSessionId` already returned by `motorPoolBridge.dispatch()` in `lib/agent-bridge.ts`), a `filesTouched` list, and a `skipReason` string (distinct from the `TaskQueueItem.error` field in `app/api/agent/tasks/route.ts`, which represents failures, not deliberate skips) alongside each task's existing `result`/`status` fields; commits and PRs opened/merged are sourced from GitHub data already synced via `lib/github/prs.ts`, no new write path required.

AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Keep active items in In Progress and P1-P3 sections.
2. Keep task bullets short and scannable.
3. Move finished work into FEATURES.md, not a Done section here.
