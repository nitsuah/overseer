# Overseer Feature Audit

Last Updated: December 1, 2025

## Summary

Documentation and implementation are aligned across the project. Key validations:

- **Community Standards**: All 10 standards have templates and modal-based PR creation ✅
- **Documentation**: All 5 core docs (ROADMAP, TASKS, METRICS, FEATURES, README) have templates and modal-based PR creation ✅
- **Best Practices**: All 4 template-based practices (Dependabot, Env Template, Docker, Netlify Badge) have modal-based PR creation ✅
- Centralized server-side logging via `lib/log.ts`; server routes and scripts use `logger` consistently.
- `.env.template` exists and is referenced in README and CONTRIBUTING; Dependabot and Docker are configured;
- ⚠️ Deploy Badge in README includes Netlify badge section but needs ability to update existing if present.
- METRICS reflect current test suite: 7 test files, 12 tests; coverage is self-reported via METRICS.md.
- **Security Enhancement**: Markdown rendering now uses react-markdown with rehype-sanitize plugin for XSS protection ✅
- **Authentication UI**: Sync All button restricted to authenticated users only ✅

_For historical improvements and version history, see CHANGELOG.md._

## Feature Detection & Display Matrix

This matrix shows what Overseer tracks, how we detect it, health indicators, and automated fixes.

Modal-based fixes are reflected directly in the "Automated Fix" column (e.g., "✅ Modal").

### Legend

**Detection Method:**

- File existence: Check if file is present
- Pattern matching: Search for patterns in filenames
- Parsing: Parse file content and extract structured data
- GitHub API: Query GitHub REST API

**Source:**

- GitHub API: Direct from GitHub
- File list scan: Scan repository file tree
- Self-reported: From METRICS.md or similar
- Composite: Calculated from multiple sources

**Health Indicator:**

- 4-state: Missing, Dormant, Malformed, Healthy
- 3-state: Missing, Dormant, Healthy
- Binary: Healthy or Missing
- Percentage: 0-100% score
- Count: Numeric count
- Color-coded: Visual indicator based on thresholds
- git-workflow (Pass/Fail/Unknown with workflow name)

**Automated Fix:**

- ✅ Template PR: Create PR with template file
- ✅ Regenerate: Re-run generation
- ❌ No: No automated fix available
- N/A: Not applicable

**Status:**

- ✅: Fully implemented and displayed
- ⚠️ Partial: Implemented but not fully integrated
- ❌ Missing: Not implemented

## 🔴 Remaining Gaps

### 1. Documentation Fix Modal (5 docs with templates)

Current: 5 core documentation files have Fix buttons with modal preview:

- ROADMAP.md ✅
- TASKS.md ✅
- METRICS.md ✅
- FEATURES.md ✅
- README.md ✅

Additional docs tracked but not yet with Fix buttons:

- CONTRIBUTING.md (tracked in both docs and community standards)

### 4. Security Configuration Tracking (Phase 7)ty standards)

- LICENSE (tracked in both docs and community standards)

**Priority**: LOW - Already covered via Community Standards section

### 2. Best Practices Fix Modal (Currently 4, could expand)

Current: 4 best practices have Fix buttons with modal preview:

- Dependabot ✅
- .env.example ✅
- Docker ✅
- Netlify Badge ✅

Tracked but no Fix buttons (6 remaining):

- CI/CD configuration
- Pre-commit Hooks
- Linting configuration
- Branch Protection
- Testing Framework
- .gitignore

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Would complete automated fix coverage for best practices

### 3. AI-Enhanced Community Standards (Dogfooding)

Overseer tracks these but doesn't have them itself at root. Could use AI to generate personalized versions:

- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (exists in templates/ only)
- SECURITY.md (exists in templates/ only)
- Issue Templates (exists in templates/ only)
- PR Template (not present in overseer root)

**Priority**: LOW - Templates exist, just need to apply them to overseer itself

### 4. Security Configuration Tracking (Phase 7)

From ROADMAP Phase 7, not yet implemented:

- Security policy presence tracking
- Security advisory configuration
- Private vulnerability reporting status
- Dependabot alerts status (enabled/disabled)
- Code scanning alerts configuration
- Secret scanning alerts configuration

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Would complete the security visibility story

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

**Next Priority Items**:

1. **GitHub OAuth Production Fix** - Blocking production deployment
2. **Gemini API Integration Fix** - AI summaries not working
3. **Test Status Integration** - Populate test status from CI/CD
4. **Security in Health Score** - Include vulnerability metrics in overall score calculation
