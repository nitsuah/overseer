## NOTE:
## Previously we redirected all /api/* paths to Netlify Functions.
## This broke Next.js App Router API routes like /api/repos by sending
## them to non-existent functions (404). It also caused /api/sync-repos
## to hit the function but fail with 500 when GITHUB_TOKEN was missing.
## We now restrict the redirect only to the explicit sync function.
