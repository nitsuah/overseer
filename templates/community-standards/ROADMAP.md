AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
This file tracks high-level project goals and milestones using a structured format.

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use ## (h2) for quarter/phase headers: "## Q1 2025", "## Phase 1", etc.
2. Items MUST use checkbox format: "- [ ]" for planned, "- [x]" for completed
3. Keep item titles on single lines
4. Optional status markers: "- [/]" for in-progress (or use "- [ ]" and note in title)
5. Headers should be quarters (Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 YEAR) or phases/milestones

STATUS MARKERS:
- [ ] = planned (not started)
- [/] = in-progress (actively working) - OPTIONAL
- [x] = completed (finished)

GOOD EXAMPLES:
## Q1 2025
- [ ] Launch beta version
- [x] Complete core infrastructure
- [/] User authentication system

## Q2 2025
- [ ] Mobile app development

BAD EXAMPLES (will break parser):
### Q1 2025 (wrong heading level)
* [ ] Item (wrong bullet marker)
- Item without checkbox
- [ ] Multi-line item
      with continuation (avoid this)

When updating:
1. Organize by time periods (quarters) or logical phases
2. Mark completed items with [x] as they finish
3. Add new strategic goals as they emerge
4. Keep items high-level (features/milestones, not individual tasks)
5. Use consistent naming: "Q1 2025", "Q2 2025", etc. for quarters
